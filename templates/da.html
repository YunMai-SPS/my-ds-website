                        <p class="section-graph">Since Open Payments Program which was established as part of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) is designed to promote transparency and provide information about financial relationships between healthcare providers (such as physicians and teaching hospitals) and pharmaceutical and medical device industries to the public, many data enthusiasts have been studying Open Payments Data to address the concerns about the potential influence of financial relationships between healthcare providers and industry on the high healthcare costs of the United States.</p>
                        <p class="custom-head_3"><span class="underline-lightblue2">What are the medical cost in different state?</span></p>
                        <p class="section-graph">In 2016, the medical cost was inbalanced across 50 states. Top 4 states expensing highest Medicare medical costs were CA($7.7M), FL($7.5M), NY($5.7M), and TX($5.6M). Top 4 state having highest drug cost were FL($1.6M), CA($1.3M), TX($1.2M), and NY($0.8M). Top 4 state having highest healthcare industry payments were CA($1.6M), TX($1.3M), NY($1.2M), and FL($1.1M).</p>

                        <p class="section-graph">The total Medicare cost per beneficiary ranged from $2 to $122K in 2016. The portion of drug cost accounting for the total cost exceeded 50% for those total Medicare costs greater than $2K and tended to grow to a higher level while the total cost increased to a higher level. (left figure). There were very few (5.1%) beneficiaries who cost a lot (>$1K) in Medicare, and very few providers (5.6%) provided services to these beneficiaries. Most of the Industry payment went to the rest 94.4% of providers whose beneficiaries spent less than or equal to $1K.There are fewer industry payments to the providers whose beneficiaries cost a lot in Medicare and also not many providers. (right figure). There were very few (5.1%) beneficiaries who cost a lot (>$1K) in Medicare, and very few providers (5.6%) provided services to these beneficiaries. Most of the Industry payment went to the rest 94.4% of providers whose beneficiaries spent less than or equal to $1K.There are fewer industry payments to the providers whose beneficiaries cost a lot in Medicare and also not many providers. (middle figure). However, it is interesting to see that the average industry payment invested for each provider tended to be higher for the providers whose beneficiary's Medicare cost was higher than that for the providers whose Medicare cost of beneficiaries was lower.

                        <p class="section-graph"><strong>Hypothesis: </strong>The industry payments or more generally medical marketing can impact providers’ attitudes and behavior in the US, such as prescribing brand-name drugs, even when equally effective generic substitutes are available, billing for more medical services or charging a higher cost per service, which would lead to an higher level of total Medicare costs, broken down by medical services and drugs.</p>

                        <p class="section-graph">There is a statistically significant positive association between industry payments and Medicare costs. According to the model, a 10% difference in industry payments was associated with ~7.62% (95% CI: 7.59%, 7.66%) higher total medical (non-drug) costs per provider. Given that the industry payment median was $255 and the Medicare cost median was $97,793, a change of $25 in industry payment would associated with a change of $1,056 in medical cost.</p>

                        <p class="section-graph">The States that had a strong positive association between those payments and costs are LA, WV, and SC. The States that had a relatively weak association between providers’ industry payments and Medicare medical costs are VT, MA, and AK. There were some similarities in the geographical patterns of the strength of the industry payments-medical costs and that of the conservative advantage.</p>
