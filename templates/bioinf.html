Analyzing high-dimensional cytometry data to identify known or novel cell populations and discriminate the differential expression of biomarkers will contribute to understanding the COVID-19 immune profile and its role in COVID-19 pathology.</p>

                        <p class="section-graph">Certain markers exhibit increased levels in COVID‐19 patients in the ICU: CCR7, CTLA-4, IL-4, IL-10, and CD25 show elevated expression in CD4+CD8- T cells, while CCR7 and IL-10 are elevated in CD8+CD4- T cells. PD-1 is upregulated in CD4+CD8+ T cells, and IL-10, CD25, IL-4, and CTLA-4 show elevated levels in CD14+ monocytes. Additionally, IL-17a and CD25 are increased in CD19+ B cells. Conversely, certain markers decrease in COVID‐19 patients in the ICU, with 4-1BB, IFNg, IL-6, and HLA-DR showing decreased expression in FOXP3 regulatory T cells. IFNg decreases in CD4+CD8- and CD8+CD4- T cells, 4-1BB decreases in CD19+ B cells, and IFNg decreases in CD14+ monocytes.</p>
